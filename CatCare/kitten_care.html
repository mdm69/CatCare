      <p>
        In the early stages of a baby kitten, they should always be with their mother. At this stage, kittens cant really see and produce there own heat. So its important to keep them by thier
        mother or if a mother isnt around, a heated blanket and a heater is strongly recommended. As well as, feeding with a tube and using baby kitten milk replacement. At around 8 weeks and older,
        this would be when they are a teenager this is when you can start choosing what food to choose, may it be dry kibble or wet food, and start to play with your kitten. Always supervise
        your kittens, they love to explore and are very curious. After four months of age, this is when they start developing really fast so its important to keep them on a four meal plan every day
        to keep up with the nutrition they need. After 6 months of age, this is the time to teach them habits or to break any habits they are obtaining. This is the perfect age to set boundaries
        and to let your kitten know what they can and cannot do in the house.

      <h2>Kitten Food</h2>
      <img src="images/img9.jpg" alt="fluffy white cat laying on the ground staring off in the distance">
      <p>
        Kittens below 8 weeks old should eat a very high nutritional diet if they are not with their mother. I would recommend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/petag-kmr-milk-replacer-food-supplements-for-kittens-and-small-animals-powder">KMR Milk Reacer Powder</a>
        , or an affordable option <a target="_blank" href="https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/petag-petlac-kitten-milk-replacement"> PetLac Kitten Milk Replacement</a>. As they get older, it is up
        to you to decide on the style of food you would want and the brand you would like to go for. Best would be a no grain diet for your kitten and as they get older or look for the first
        ingredient on the label and that it is a meat. And dont feel strange to switch any food. But do keep in mind when it comes to switching a kittens or any age that you slowly switch by mixing
        a little bit of the new food.

      <h2>Good Behavior</h2>
      <img src="images/img10.jpg" alt="cat laying down ready to play with paws upwards">
      <p>
        During socializing and training your kitten it is important to let them experience their surrounding. It is okay to worry and not them let get hurt or make them scared. But if they
        are not exposed to sounds, or looking outside or what you do everyday, they might not be able to handle their environment. So when you do bring them to these loud places or something
        that might be scary to them, bring treats or lots of pets to let them know they are doing good and that their is no harm. Another good way to teach your kitten is to let them know when they
        are doing something bad vs good. That if they overcome their fear or use the litter box that they get lots of pets or some treats. While if they did something bad, they get scolded and
        no attention. During kittenhood, this is the best time to teach anything you want them to learn.
